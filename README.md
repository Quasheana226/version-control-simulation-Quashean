First time i submited i feel like i was rushing but after class i just didnt feel rght. I felt like im starting off wrong so i took time and pulled up some youtube videos to get a better understanding of what git was.


The first thing i did was read through everything so i could get a better understanding of what the assignment ask first thing i did was clone my repo url link in my terminal and begin to work. i then created a index.html use !. i then added a feature/header branch to my local repo then i did a commit explaining what i did. The next thing i was ask to make another branch feature/header and did some modification to the index file. Then after that step i did a git commit -am and left a discription of what i changed. I then attempt to merge and recived a conflict so then i did a git status to make sure it was resolved but before that step i pushed to git hub



learning git was hard but with a little studying i think i like git a little lol
